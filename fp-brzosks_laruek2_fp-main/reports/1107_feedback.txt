This looks good to me! Since your first milestone involves a bunch of research and learning about stuff, it would be great if your milestone report included a bit of a writeup summarizing what you learned and detailing the techniques you have/plan to implement. Hopefully at that point you will also report on ideas for specific approaches to accelerating both that you'll work on towards the end of the project.
