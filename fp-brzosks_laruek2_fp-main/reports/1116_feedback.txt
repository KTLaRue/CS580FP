It seems like you focused on volumetric lighting instead of global illumination for MS1. This is fine, but I would have liked to see an updated plan for the remainder of the project in light of these changes. If you want to pivot a little bit and focus more on getting deep into volumetric lighting, that would be okay with me, but you'll need to do some research (as we discussed in office hours today) and implement something much more sophisticated. Feel free to chat with me about this, but either way please make sure your MS2 report includes an updated plan for the remainder of the project.
